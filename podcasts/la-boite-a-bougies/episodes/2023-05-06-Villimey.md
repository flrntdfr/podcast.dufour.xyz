It is said that a name can tell a lot about a person. When you pay attention to Villimey Mist (Villi = wild, mey = virgin, mist = haze), you can feel the mysterious sparkle of Icelandic culture appearing within English word cloud.
Letâ€™s explore today the roots of horror stories and the art of giving life to our worst nightmares.  
Have you ever been betrayed? Have you noticed sharp teeth sticking out a strangerâ€™s lips in the street tonight? Let yourself get carried away by an night owl prose into the hands of bloody terror.
